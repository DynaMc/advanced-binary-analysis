    "In this step, you will build an emulator from the ground up by using LIEF and Unicorn Engine, once the emulator is complete, you will be able to use it to extract the packed payload without having to analyze and understand what the unpacking routine is doing. By the end of this step, you will have learned the following:\n",

It's also possible to recode it from scratch if you wish. In the Jupyter UI, you can choose `Run > Run All Cells` to perform all steps in the lab at once, or you can run each step manually. It is recommended to only run a cell once you have read and understood what it does.\n",

    "This class is quite a handful, but it only has two methods that do anything complicated. Let's break them down one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breakdown of `Emulator.__init__`\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is responsible for creating the emulator wrapper. It can be thought of as a simplified loader. Going through the numbered code blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First the method defines some variables which will be used to trace the instruction history, the registered function stubs, and the symbols that are imported by the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A chunk of memory is mapped to the emulator's state for the stack. The registers `rbp` and `rsp` are set to point at the top of the stack, because the stack grows downwards (Allocating space by calling `sub rsp, <space>;`)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We perform the job that the ELF loader would do by calculating the total memory size required to map the code and data segments of the sample into memory, then map that memory for Unicorn and copy (`uc.mem_write`) the bytes into the mapped memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We continue performing the loader's job by walking through the relocation entries and identifying those which are for external symbols (`reloc.has_symbol`). When they do, we perform the relocation and store the imported symbol name in `self.imports`. Since we are not loading the external libraries, this is necessary to detect calls into external code and stop the emulator if the call is not handled by our script.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Hooks are registered with Unicorn so that it calls our wrapper on every single instruction and whenever an access to unmapped memory (segmentation fault) occurs. The latter is handled by dumping out recently emulated instruction adddresses for manual investigation, and the former is handled by the `_on_rip_updated_method` which will be broken down next.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. This is necessary because Linux stores the stack cookie at `FS:[0x28]` which needs to be mapped. We map the first page of memory (`0000 - 1000`) to avoid segmentation faults.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breakdown of `Emulator._on_rip_updated`\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is called on every instruction pointer update and is responsible for the bulk of added functionality. It performs instruction history tracking, as well as stubbed address lookups and dispatching.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Update the history by keeping the last 10 instruction addresses that have executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stub lookup and dispatch. If the address is an imported symbol and doesn't have an associated stub, then execution cannot continue, so print an error and stop emulating. Otherwise, if the address has an associated stub, call the stub and clean up the stack by simulating a `ret` instruction (`mov rip, [rsp]; add rsp, 8`), thus returning code execution to the calling function and skipping the stubbed function code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stubbing External Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all well and good, but if you were to try to run the emulation right now, the very first thing that you would get is the error message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ERROR: Imported function called without a stub: malloc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sense because looking back at `main`, it does indeed start with a `malloc`, followed by a `rand`. There is no good way to know if ths initialization is important, so we ought to stub as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be a very tedious process, and having good instrumentation is important to properly identify external calls. Some samples obfuscate external calls as well, meaning that the approach shown here might not always work. In general, the cycle for stubbing out a function can be described in 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lookup the function signature and documentation\n",
    "2. Implement the side effects in the host script\n",
    "3. Test that the emulated code makes it past the stub.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated over and over, until enough external calls are stubbed for the emulation to proceed to the desired point.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Stubbing can be used for complex functions that take time to emulate, when a native implementation can be used instead (e.g. `md5`, `sha1`,  `zlib`, and more)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll abstract away a simple heap implementation to stub all of the memory management calls. This will make it possible to track memory allocations to recover the unpacked module."

    "The code should be straightforward as it is only implementing the functions by modifying the CPU and memory state of the emulator. We will work through the example of how `memcpy` was stubbed, as the principle can be generalized to all stubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we look at the manual entry for `memcpy`, more specifically the function signature, its return value, and what its side effects are.\n",

    "       memcpy - copy memory area\n",

    "SYNOPSIS\n",
    "       #include <string.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "       void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);\n",
    "\n",
    "DESCRIPTION\n",
    "       The memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest.  The memory areas must not overlap.\n",
    "       Use memmove(3) if the memory areas do overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "RETURN VALUE\n",
    "       The memcpy() function returns a pointer to dest.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, we'll need to read `n` bytes from `src` and write them to `dst`. Then we must return `dst`. In x64 Linux, the [calling convention][cconv] for the first 6 arguments is `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `rcx`, `r8` and `r9`. The return value is in `rax`. This should be enough for most function stubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we first read the register values of `rdi`, `rsi`, and `rdx` using `uc.reg_read`, then we read `rdx` bytes from the address in `rsi` using `uc.mem_read` and write them into the address at `rdi` using `uc.mem_write`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we set `rax` to the value of `rdi`, which is the destination buffer, using `uc.reg_write`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all. Now our function stub will alter the CPU and memory state in the same way as the real memcpy would.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive\n",
    ": Optional: Implement a stub for `free` so that it removes the block from the heap chunks. Do not worry about heap implementation details such as free lists and memory reuse.\n",

    "That's all there is to it! This short snippet of code actually has a lot going on though, so let's walk through it step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code starts by creating a `call_state` at the start address of the code that we want to emulate. Angr provides several state factories which initialize various parts of the CPU. The `call_state` factory initializes a stack, sets the value of `RSP` and sets the values of any arguments in the registers and on the stack according to a calling convention. It also writes the return address on the stack, and leaves everything else uninitialized.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In this case we do not have any arguments and do not care about the return value, but this saves us from having to manually setup the state. We also set `RBP` to `RSP` so that the stack size is 0 and that code references to `[RBP + xxx]` will work on concrete values. This is necessary because the code that we want to execute addresses local variables on its stack relative to `RBP`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two symbols are created to represent the input data (32 bits wide) and the resulting opcode. You can think of symbols as algebraic variables that can hold arbitrary values. Throughout the execution, the symbolic execution engine will compute the transformations on those symbols and build an abstract syntax tree (AST) which represents the behavior of the code on the symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. By themselves, the symbols won't achieve much, they must be placed in the memory state so that angr's engine encounters and uses the symbols in its execution. This code is placing the `opcode` symbol at the location in memory which we established stores the final opcode and the `input` symbol at an arbitrary memory address which will be used to represent the command and control's response buffer containing the command to execute. Because we start our code right after the memory address of that buffer has been put in RAX, the script directly puts the chosen address into RAX.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. With the CPU and memory state ready for execution, the a simulation manager is created which will store the various possible next states. By default, branches will result in two states being created in the simulation, one where the branch is taken, and one where it isn't. The script simply loops through all possible states until the first state which starts on an instruction that happens after the expected end block is reached. This approach works for this specific case because the function  does not trample the local variables and is fairly linear. Some scenarios might require more complex state management.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. With the final state found, the \"value\" at the memory location where the opcode would normally be is now an AST which represents all the transformations that have occurred to get from `input` to `opcode`. Just like a high school math problem, we plug the value of `x` (`x` being `opcode`, in this case) to the value we expect it to be, and ask Angr's solver engine to find `input`.\n",
